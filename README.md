# Techniques
- [Vite](https://vite.dev): Vite (pronounced "veet") is a frontend build tool and development server designed to provide a faster and more streamlined development experience for modern web projects. It's known for its blazing fast startup times and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- [React.js](https://react.dev): React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is known for its component-based architecture and efficient updates to the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). React allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to build complex and dynamic user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft that serves as a superset of JavaScript. This means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, but TypeScript adds additional features, primarily optional static typing.
- [Radix Ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/): Radix UI is an open-source, headless UI component library for React, known for its focus on accessibility and customization. It provides a set of unstyled, composable components that allow developers to build high-quality user interfaces with complete control over the look and feel. Essentially, Radix UI offers the functionality of UI components without any pre-defined styling, enabling developers to integrate them seamlessly with any CSS framework or styling solution.
