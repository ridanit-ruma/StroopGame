# üß† Stroop Game
> 2025 Raon - Raness Book Event
A simple Stroop Challenge game that can be enjoyed via web access. It was created using Vite + React + Typescript templates, and the user interface was configured based on Radix UI.

# ‚ùìÔ∏è What is the Stroop Game?
The Stroop game, based on the Stroop effect, is a psychological test where participants name the color of ink that a word is printed in, while the word itself is a different color name. For example, the word "blue" might be printed in red ink. The challenge is to ignore the word itself and focus on saying the ink color. This creates interference because the brain automatically wants to read the word, even when it's not relevant to the task.

# üéÆ Game Rules
When you press the start game button, the Stroop game will start. You will be given 60 seconds and there are 16 choices. You have to quickly find the double letters and the color of the letters that have the same meaning within 60 seconds. When the game is over, you can see your record on the home screen. The best record is recorded in the browser and will not be lost when you reconnect.

# üîß Techniques
- [Vite](https://vite.dev): Vite (pronounced "veet") is a frontend build tool and development server designed to provide a faster and more streamlined development experience for modern web projects. It's known for its blazing fast startup times and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- [React.js](https://react.dev): React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is known for its component-based architecture and efficient updates to the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). React allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to build complex and dynamic user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft that serves as a superset of JavaScript. This means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, but TypeScript adds additional features, primarily optional static typing.
- [Radix Ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/): Radix UI is an open-source, headless UI component library for React, known for its focus on accessibility and customization. It provides a set of unstyled, composable components that allow developers to build high-quality user interfaces with complete control over the look and feel. Essentially, Radix UI offers the functionality of UI components without any pre-defined styling, enabling developers to integrate them seamlessly with any CSS framework or styling solution.
